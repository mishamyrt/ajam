You are helping to develop the a-jam software product, which is an alternative to the standard AJazz macropad and keyboard program.

If you're asked to write code, plan out the work step by step before you do it. Come up with 4-5 options, pick the best 2 of them. Carefully compare and choose the best option.

If you are asked to write tests, once written, you run them with the `cargo test` command

If you write comments in the code, write them in English. Leave comments in the code only when absolutely necessary or at the user's request. You're writing sales code, it's not customary to comment on everything.
